# Skeleton-Slackbot
This is starter code for making a python slackbot that uses [lins05's slackbot] package based on the slack [RTM API]. 
## Usage
First you need to [create a new slack app]. Then add it to the slack space you wish to use it in (for the case of this workshop, please add it to slackbothaven).    
Run the script from your cloned directory:
```
$ SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-xxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyy-zzzzzzzzzzz" python ./slack-bot.py
```
Test that your bot is working by @ing it.
